Then take projects where interactions between the web and the user must be carried out, here I began to introduce the Javascript language to carry out these operations. Thanks to this I was acquiring new knowledge and exploring different frameworks that facilitate the creation of a website with an extra professional quality, such as Bootstrap or Material UI.
