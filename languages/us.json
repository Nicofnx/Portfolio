Thanks to this I was acquiring new knowledge and exploring different frameworks that facilitate the creation of a website with an extra professional quality, such as Bootstrap or Material UI. In summary, in these two years I implemented knowledge in HTML5, CCS3, Javascript ES6, React, JQuery, Git and JIRA/ClickUp",

It teaches you the entire language from scratch, starting with data types, variables, scopes, functions, etc. to the latest and most advanced. To date, it has more than 100 videos, it continues to upload with the latest updates coming out of Javascipt. I highly recommend it!",

Just like JS, it starts from level 0 for people who have absolutely no knowledge, starting from the installation of React to the use of hooks, use of apis, ajax, fetch, among other things. Thanks to these videos by Jon Mircha I continue to learn React.",
